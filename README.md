# Crypto-web
This is debut website of mine of live crypto data, exchange information, event news and more. 

This project was done for Vilnius Coding School bootcamp final exam.

Signup, signin, logout and newsletter form is made with PHP. The widget area, "Learn more" button is made with JavaScript. Rest is HTML, Bootstrap and SASS.
